        <h1> A Symbiotic Future for Machine Learning and the Humanities</h1>
            <p>Computational methods can help the humanities by making massive cultural heritage collections more explorable and analyzable. 
                Machine learning and statistical methods provide an opportunity to view collections from alien, defamiliarized perspectives 
                that can call into question the boundaries between established categories. But the converse is also true: the humanities have
                 much to offer machine learning. The use of computational methods within humanities scholarship often tests and expands the 
                 affordances of these methods. The complexities and idiosyncrasies of humanities collections can improve our understanding 
                 of what models learn and how we might direct what they learn.

                In this talk, Laure Thompson will discuss how machine learning and the humanities help each other. She will demonstrate how 
                convolutional neural  networks can be used as an exploratory tool to ask "What is Dada?" Then, she will show how science-fiction
                 novels highlight the way topic models tend to learn author- and series-oriented discourses, and how they have inspired a method 
                 for directing these models toward more cross-cutting themes. Finally, Thompson will briefly describe how these two lines of work 
                 are being combined to enable the study of magical gems, an art-historic category of engraved gemstones from the Greco-Roman world.
